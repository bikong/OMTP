THIS TOOLKIT INCLUDES THE MATLAB IMPLEMENTATION OF GRID SEARCH, PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION, GENETIC ALGORITHM AND GRAVITATIONAL SEARCH ALGORITHM. EACH ALGORITHM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN BOTH DOUBLE PARAMETERS(ERROR PENALTY PARAMETERS C, KERNEL PARAMETER G) SIMULTANEOUS OPTIMIZATION AND TRIPLE PARAMETERS(ERROR PENALTY PARAMETERS C, KERNEL PARAMETER G, INSENSITIVE LOSS FUNCTION PARAMETER P) SIMULTANEOUS OPTIMIZATON. 

THE FUNCTION FOR PERFORMING EACH OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM IS IN EACH (OPTIMIZATION METHOD)SVR(OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS).m, YOU CAN EASILY USE THEM BY CALL THE CORRESPONDING FUNCTION BY READING COMMENT. BESIDES, FOR EACH OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS, THERE ARE SOME INNER PARAMETERS,AND YOU CAN KEEP THE DEFAULT VALUES OR ADJUST THEM FOR BETTER SERVING YOUR APPLICATION.
